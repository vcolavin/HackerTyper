HackerTyper
===========

Ruby command line clone of hackertyper.net, mostly completed in one afternoon for fun at DBC.

Will take one ARGV argument for a pathname to the file to open. If no argument is given, defaults to opening and typing itself.

It might only work on Unix like systems. I haven't tested it on Windows but I suspect it will not work.
